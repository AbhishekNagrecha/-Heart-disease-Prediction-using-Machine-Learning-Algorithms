# Predicting-Heart-disease-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Given clinical parameters about a patient, in this project my mprimary aim was to predict whether or not they have heart disease.For this I utilized a dataset available at the UCI machine learning repository.
For experiment purpose I only decided to use 14 of the toal available feature.After carefully observing the data I decided to apply the necessary pre-processing steps to structure the data appropriately.then I applied three ML algorithms namely Logistic regression,SVM and KNN with and without tuning the hyperparameters using randomized search 5-fold cross validation technique.
SVM proved to be the best classifier with an accuracy of 0.94.
